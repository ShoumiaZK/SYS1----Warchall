# Wechall : Warchall the beginning 
This repo contains all the ways I solve some levels of a Wechall challenge : "Warchall : the beginning"; using Linux commands.   
Access the instructions at : https://www.wechall.net/challenge/warchall/begins/index.php

#### There are some formalities to complete before starting the challenge :
* Creating a Wechall account or being loged in
* Setting twice the same password  
  Then to start the game, you have to connect through ssh and enter the password you set earlier : 
```sh
ssh yourusername@warchall.net -p 19198
```
### Choose the level you want to go to:
* [Welcome to Warchall](Warchall00.md)
* [Level 1](Warchall01.md)
* [Level 2](Warchall02.md)
* [Level 3](Warchall03.md)
* [Level 4](Warchall04.md)
* [Level 5](Warchall05.md)

Then you enter all the flags in the site's prompt to get more points.
